Imagine that a friend of yours runs a non-profit organization around political activism. A number of people have registered for an upcoming event. She has asked for our help in engaging these future attendees. Enter EventManager, a program which will write and output tahnk you letters as html using erb templating.

-manipulate file input and output
-read content from a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file
-transform it into a standardized format
-utilize the data to contact a remote service
-populate a template with user data
-manipulate strings
